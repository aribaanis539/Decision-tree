## About <a name = "about"></a>
The implementation of predicting the occupancy status of the room. The accuracy of the prediction of occupancy in an office room using data from light, temperature, humidity and CO2 sensors has been evaluated with different statistical classification models like Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest and Boosted Ran- dom Forest Classifier.Three data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository were used in this work, one for training and two for testing the models. The results from the various experiments show that a proper selection of features together with an appropriate classification model can have a significant impact on the accuracy prediction of the occupancy status of the room. Typically, the best accuracy is obtained from training

## Case Handling <a name = "case_handling"></a>
The decision tree is designed to adeptly handle various exceptional scenarios, including:

Multiple true conditions within a node.
Ambiguous or missing data for specific variables.
Unforeseen combinations of input values.
Outliers or extreme values affecting decision outcomes.
Situations where certain variables are undefined or null.
Dynamic adjustments for evolving data patterns.
Handling of conflicting or contradictory information within the dataset.

## Built Using <a name = "built_using"></a>
- C++
